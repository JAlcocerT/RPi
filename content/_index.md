title: "RPi A-Z Setup and Projects"
---

The **Raspberry Pi** is a tiny computer, low power consumption (ARM based) that you can use to learn programming through fun, practical projects and also allow us to have our own server to run 24/7 tasks that donâ€™t require the expensive hardware of a PC. 1

It can run Linux distributions like: Debian, OpenMediaVault or most commonly Raspbian OS.

All of the services/projects that we can make the RPi to run, can be easily ported to some cloud service, VPS and so on. So it serves as an entry point to learn also about that as well.

Due to the compatibility between raspbian and most debian based linux, most of the topic here will reference some guides on how to setup a general linux server, including an extra explanation here where some specifics apply to the RPi.
