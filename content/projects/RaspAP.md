Make your RPi work as a router that you can trust on your trips while connecting to unknown networks:


```sh
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get full-upgrade
 sudo reboot
 
 sudo raspi-config
 
curl -sL https://install.raspap.com | bash
```

Following a reboot, the wireless AP network will be configured as follows:


```sh
IP address: 10.3.141.1
Username: admin 
Password: secret
DHCP range: 10.3.141.50 â€” 10.3.141.255
SSID: raspi-webgui
Password: ChangeMe
```
