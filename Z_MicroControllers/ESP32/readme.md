    REST API (HTTP):
        RESTful APIs are widely used for communication between clients and servers over HTTP.
        They are well-suited for request-response interactions and are easy to understand and implement.
        However, they may not be the best choice for real-time communication as they are based on the request-response model, which can introduce latency and overhead for real-time updates.
        REST APIs are suitable for scenarios where real-time updates are not critical or where the frequency of updates is low.

    WebSockets:
        WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
        They offer low-latency, high-performance communication and are well-suited for applications requiring real-time updates, such as chat applications, live dashboards, and multiplayer games.
        WebSockets can be more complex to implement compared to REST APIs, but they offer significant benefits for real-time applications.

    MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport):
        MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks.
        It provides a flexible and efficient mechanism for asynchronous, real-time communication between clients and servers.
        MQTT is commonly used in IoT (Internet of Things) applications, telemetry systems, and messaging applications where real-time data streams need to be transmitted reliably and efficiently.
        While MQTT can be used for real-time communication in various scenarios, it may not be as widely supported or as easy to integrate as REST APIs or WebSockets in certain contexts.
