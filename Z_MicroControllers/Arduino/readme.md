Technically Not a Microcontroller: Strictly speaking, Arduino itself is not a microcontroller.

An Arduino board is a development board that typically includes:

Microcontroller: This is the core programmable chip responsible for processing and controlling functions. Common microcontrollers used on Arduino boards include the Atmel AVR and Atmel SAM series.
Support circuitry: Additional electronic components like voltage regulators, USB interface chips, and input/output (I/O) pins to connect sensors and actuators.
Development environment: The Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software platform that allows you to write code for the microcontroller on the Arduino board.
Essentially Functions as One: However, from a user's perspective, an Arduino board acts very much like a standalone microcontroller. You can program it using the Arduino IDE to interact with sensors, control outputs, and perform various tasks
