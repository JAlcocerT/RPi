Functionally, it:

Activates Wi‑Fi and tries to connect using ssid/password.

GETs https://fossengineer.com and prints the raw HTML bytes to the serial console.
GETs http://date.jsontest.com/, prints the full JSON object, then prints just the time field.

Wait for Wi‑Fi to actually connect before requesting (so requests may fail).
Close responses (r.close()), handle errors, or set the device’s clock from the fetched time.
