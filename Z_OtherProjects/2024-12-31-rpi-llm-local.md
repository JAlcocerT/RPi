### How to Enhance a Raspberry Pi for AI

* Edge TPU on RPi - Coral Edge TPU (Tensor Processing Unit - an USB acccelerator )

TPU (Tensor Processing Unit):

Focus: TPUs are specifically **designed for running Google's TensorFlow** machine learning framework. They are optimized for high-performance matrix multiplication, a fundamental operation in many deep learning algorithms.
Architecture: TPUs are custom-designed by Google with a focus on maximizing performance for TensorFlow workloads. They prioritize speed and efficiency for specific tasks within the TensorFlow ecosystem.

> You will hear more and more about NPU - Neural Processing Units


While both are designed to **handle AI workloads**, they have distinct differences in their focus, architecture, and availability.

NPUs are designed to mimic the structure and function of the human brain, excelling at tasks that involve large-scale parallel processing.

They are particularly well-suited for **various AI applications**, including:

- üñºÔ∏è Image recognition
- üí¨ Natural language processing
- üó£Ô∏è Speech recognition


NPUs typically utilize a manycore architecture with specialized instructions and data formats optimized for AI algorithms. This allows them to handle complex neural networks efficiently.

NPUs are often integrated into mobile processors from companies like Apple, Huawei, and Samsung. They are also available as standalone chips from some manufacturers.
