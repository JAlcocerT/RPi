## Software

### Taking Pictures and Streaming Video

Enable the camera:

```sh
sudo raspi-config #Interface Options -> Enable camera Support
```

Take a picture simply with: <!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhM1NhD-kGs -->

```sh
raspistill -o pico.jpg
#scp yourraspbiuser@192.168.3.130:/home/reisipi/pico.jpg . #copy it to windows CMD
```
* And now video streaming with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/meinside/rpi-mjpg-streamer #https://github.com/JAlcocerT/rpi-mjpg-streamer
cd rpi-mjpg-streamer
```

Build the image:

```sh
docker build -t streamer:latest \
		--build-arg PORT=9999 \
		--build-arg RESOLUTION=400x300 \
		--build-arg FPS=24 \
		--build-arg ANGLE=0 \
		--build-arg FLIPPED=false \
		--build-arg MIRRORED=false \
		--build-arg USERNAME=user \
		--build-arg PASSWORD=some-password \
		.
```

Deploy the image:

```sh
docker run -p 9999:9999 --device /dev/video0 -it streamer:latest
```

And we will have the interface ready at the specified port: `localhost:9999`

> Working **up to GNU v11** (not available in bookworm!)

### TensorFlow Lite

* A)
<!-- Tensorflow Lite with Object Detection on Raspberry Pi!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX6zWqMP9U4 -->

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/examples --depth 1 #https://github.com/JAlcocerT/tf-examples
cd examples
```

Create a Py venv:

```sh
python3 -m pip install virtualenv

# Successfully installed distlib-0.3.8 filelock-3.15.4 platformdirs-4.2.2 virtualenv-20.26.3

python3 -m venv tf
source tf/bin/activate
cd ./lite/examples/object_detection/raspberry_pi
sh setup.sh
```

Or a Conda one if you prefer:

```sh
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-armv7l.sh

chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-armv7l.sh
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-armv7l.sh
source ~/.bashrc
#conda --version

conda create --name myenv python=3.7.3
conda activate myenv
python --version
```
Once all dependencies are installed in the chose isolated environment:

```sh
python3 detect.py --model efficientdet_lite0.tflite
```

### MotionEyeOS

A Video Surveillance OS For Single-board Computers 

* https://github.com/motioneye-project/motioneyeos
	* https://github.com/motioneye-project/motioneye/wiki/Install-In-Docker#image-from-docker-hub

```sh
docker run --name="motioneye" \
    -p 8765:8765 \
    --hostname="motioneye" \
    -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
    -v /etc/motioneye:/etc/motioneye \
    -v /var/lib/motioneye:/var/lib/motioneye \
    --restart="always" \
    --detach=true \
	ccrisan/motioneye:master-armhf
    #ccrisan/motioneye:master-amd64 #https://hub.docker.com/r/ccrisan/motioneye
```

Now, you will access MotionEye at `localhost:8765` with default user: `admin` and blank (no password).

> motionEyeOS is a Linux distribution that turns a single-board computer into a video surveillance system. 

### Frigate

* https://docs.frigate.video/

A complete and local NVR designed for Home Assistant with AI object detection. Uses OpenCV and Tensorflow to perform realtime object detection locally for IP cameras.

### How to use Ollama with a Raspberry Pi

You can [SelfHost Ollama with Docker](https://fossengineer.com/selfhosting-llms-ollama/) and choose a small enough model that it will fit in the RAM.

### What are microservices?

### What are Web-Hooks?

A webhook is like a doorbell. When certain events happen in one system (like a new post on a blog or a new commit in a repository), it automatically sends a notification to another system. It's a way for apps to provide other applications with real-time information.

* How It Works: A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately. You set up a webhook by providing a URL to the system you want to receive the notifications. When an event occurs, the system makes an HTTP request (usually POST) to the URL you provided.

* Use Case Example: A common use of webhooks is in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. For example, GitHub can use a webhook to notify a CI server like Jenkins to start a new build whenever code is pushed to a repository.

### What are API calls?

An API call is like making a phone call to a specific service. You request the information or service you need, and the system responds back. It's a way for applications to interact and request data from each other.

* How It Works: An API call is a manual process; you have to make the request to get the data. Itâ€™s like asking, "Do you have any new data?" The request is usually made via HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and the server processes the request and sends back a response.

* Use Case Example: If you have an application that needs to get the latest weather data, it can make an API call to a weather service. The application sends a request, and the weather service responds with the latest weather information.

### WebHooks vs API Calls

* Initiation:
  * Webhook: Automatically initiated by the source system when an event occurs.
  * API Call: Manually initiated by the requesting system.
* Purpose:
  * Webhook: Used for real-time notifications.
  * API Call: Used for requesting or sending data on demand.
* Direction:
  * Webhook: One-way from the source to the receiver.
  * API Call: Two-way communication between the requester and the server.
