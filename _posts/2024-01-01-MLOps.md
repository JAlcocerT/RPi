## SonarQube

GitHub Actions can be used to trigger SonarQube scans on various events like push or pull requests.
You can add a step in your GitHub Actions workflow to run the SonarQube scanner. This involves setting up the SonarQube server details and running the analysis as part of your GitHub Actions pipeline.

### SQ with Jenkins

Jenkins offers a SonarQube plugin that allows for easy integration.

Once the plugin is installed, you can configure a Jenkins job to trigger SonarQube scans. This can include providing the SonarQube server configuration and specifying the project key and token in the job configuration.

### SQ with Gitea
While Gitea does not have direct plugin support like Jenkins, you can still integrate SonarQube into your Gitea pipelines using webhook triggers or by manually configuring CI/CD tools (like Drone, which integrates with Gitea) to run SonarQube scans.

Webhooks: Use webhooks in Gitea to trigger external CI/CD tools on events like push or pull requests.
CI/CD Tool: In your CI/CD pipeline configuration (like a .drone.yml file for Drone CI), add steps to execute the SonarQube scanner.

## FAQ

### What are microservices?

### What are Web-Hooks?

A webhook is like a doorbell. When certain events happen in one system (like a new post on a blog or a new commit in a repository), it automatically sends a notification to another system. It's a way for apps to provide other applications with real-time information.

* How It Works: A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately. You set up a webhook by providing a URL to the system you want to receive the notifications. When an event occurs, the system makes an HTTP request (usually POST) to the URL you provided.
* Use Case Example: A common use of webhooks is in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. For example, GitHub can use a webhook to notify a CI server like Jenkins to start a new build whenever code is pushed to a repository.

### What are API calls?

An API call is like making a phone call to a specific service. You request the information or service you need, and the system responds back. It's a way for applications to interact and request data from each other.

* How It Works: An API call is a manual process; you have to make the request to get the data. Itâ€™s like asking, "Do you have any new data?" The request is usually made via HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and the server processes the request and sends back a response.
* Use Case Example: If you have an application that needs to get the latest weather data, it can make an API call to a weather service. The application sends a request, and the weather service responds with the latest weather information.

### WebHooks vs API Calls

* Initiation:
  * Webhook: Automatically initiated by the source system when an event occurs.
  * API Call: Manually initiated by the requesting system.
* Purpose:
  * Webhook: Used for real-time notifications.
  * API Call: Used for requesting or sending data on demand.
* Direction:
  * Webhook: One-way from the source to the receiver.
  * API Call: Two-way communication between the requester and the server.
