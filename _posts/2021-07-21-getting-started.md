# A journey with the Rpi

 Fuel your curiosity with Raspberry Pi - the single board computer that's redefining the future of technology.

## Why RPi?

The Raspberry Pi is a tiny computer, low power consumption (ARM based) that you can use to learn programming through fun, practical projects and also allow us to have our own server to run 24/7 tasks that donâ€™t require the expensive hardware of a PC.

It can run Linux distributions like: Debian, OpenMediaVault or most commonly Raspbian OS. It can also run Android.

All of the services/projects that we can make the RPi to run, can be easily ported to some cloud service, VPS and so on. So it serves as an entry point to learn also about that as well.

## How to Get Started with a RPi?

First I would recommend you to install Raspbian to the RPi.

Raspbian is based on Debian, a Linux distribution. But you dont have to be worried about this as I have created to onboard anyone to Linux and particularly to [Debian based distros here](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/debian/).

Under the **RPi Setup** section on this page, I will be including an extra explanation here where some specifics apply to the RPi.


```sh
$ apt update
$ apt upgrade
```

> There are [other Single Board Computers](https://fossengineer.com/testing-performance-orange-pi5-versus-raspberry-pi4/) out there that you can use to do similar projects.

### Other OS's

### Android in a Raspberry Pi?

#### Lineage OS

* Visit: <https://konstakang.com/devices/rpi4/>
* Download the latest version: <https://konstakang.com/devices/rpi4/LineageOS20/>
* Create a bootable SD card with the image and boot it
* Download the MindTheGapps file that matches your Lineage version and reboot into recovery mode, then load that file and Google Play Store will be ready to use.

### Home Assistant OS

Get ready RPi Imager and Select: Other Speficic Purpose OS -> HA and Home Automation.

Make sure your Pi is connected to ethernet when booting and you will get a local IP with port 8123 to see the **UI of the installation**

>  [Add-ons](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons) are only available with the Home Assistant Operating System.

After a while, this will be saying Hi to you:

You can give **HA a try with Docker** as well.

But you wont see these:

```sh
ha --help
```

#### Other Home Automations / IoT OS

Homebridge, OpenHAB... (you can also install them with Rpi Imager).


## Analytical Software for IoT Projects

| Tool | FOSS | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|------|
| **KNIME** | Yes | User-friendly, visual data pipeline design. Extensive plugin ecosystem. Good for non-programmers. Strong in data preprocessing and analysis | Can be less intuitive for complex, custom data analysis. Performance issues with very large datasets |
| **Tableau** | No | Exceptional data visualization capabilities. Intuitive and user-friendly. Strong in business intelligence | Expensive. Not open source. More focused on visualization than data modeling |
| **Alteryx** | No | Strong in data blending and preparation. Advanced analytics capabilities. Good integration with other tools | Expensive. Not open source. Steeper learning curve |
| **RapidMiner** | No | Comprehensive data science platform. Good for machine learning and predictive modeling. User-friendly with a visual approach | Free version is limited. Can be expensive for the full version. Steep learning curve for advanced features |
| **QlikView/Qlik Sense** | No | Powerful for interactive data discovery and BI. Flexible and customizable. Good data integration | Can be expensive. Steeper learning curve compared to some competitors. Not open source |
| **Python Libraries** (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn) | Yes | Highly flexible and powerful. Huge ecosystem and community. Ideal for custom, complex analysis | Requires programming knowledge. Steeper learning curve for non-programmers |
| **R Libraries** (e.g., ggplot2, dplyr) | Yes | Excellent for statistical analysis and data visualization. Large number of packages for various analyses. Strong academic and research community support | Requires programming knowledge. Less intuitive for those unfamiliar with R |
| **Metabase** | Yes | Easy to use for creating dashboards and reports. Strong in data visualization and business intelligence. Supports a wide range of databases | Limited in advanced analytics capabilities. Not as flexible for custom data processing as some other tools |
| **Apache Superset** | Yes | Open-source data visualization and data exploration platform. Supports SQL querying. Customizable and extensible | Requires technical knowledge for setup and customization. May have performance issues with very large datasets |
| **Kibana** | Yes | Part of the Elastic Stack, excellent for visualizing Elasticsearch data. Great for log and time-series analytics. Real-time data visualization | Primarily tailored to Elasticsearch data. Can be complex to configure and optimize. Less versatile for non-Elasticsearch data |
