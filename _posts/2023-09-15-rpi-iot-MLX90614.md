## Raspberry PI and the MLX90614 IR Temp Sensor

* What we will be doing:
    * Read Data from [MLX90614 sensor](#the-mlx90614-sensor) with Python
    * Push the Data to InfluxDB
    * Visualize the MLX90614 sensor temperature data with [Grafana](#grafana-dashboard)

### The MLX90614 Sensor

The **MLX90614 GY-906** is an infrared **(IR) temperature sensor** module commonly used for non-contact temperature measurements. It's also known as a pyrometer or non-contact thermometer. 

* Working Principle: The sensor measures the infrared radiation emitted by an object to determine its temperature.
    *  All objects emit thermal radiation based on their temperature, and this radiation falls within the infrared spectrum. 

* Accuracy and Range: The MLX90614 GY-906 sensor can offer a relatively high level of accuracy for non-contact temperature measurements.
    * It has a wide temperature measurement range, typically spanning from **-70°C to 380°C** (-94°F to 716°F), depending on the specific model and calibration.

* Two Sensors in One: The sensor actually contains two separate sensors within a single package: one to measure the temperature of the object being measured (object temperature) and another to measure the temperature of the sensor itself (ambient temperature).
    * This dual-sensor setup helps improve accuracy, as it compensates for changes in the sensor's ambient temperature.

* Communication Interface: The MLX90614 GY-906 sensor can communicate with other devices using the **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication protocol**.


> Dont forget to **enable I2C** in the Raspberry Pi. 
```sh
sudo raspi-config
#-> interfacing options
#-> enable I2C
reboot #it is a must, I already try not to
```
{: .prompt-info }


* This video and github where really helpfull to me to get started:
    * <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CftxT8k0jww&t=5s>
    * <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STJRush/handycode/master/ALT4%20Sensors%20Inputs%20Outputs/Raspberry%20PI%20Sensors/MLX90614%20Infrared%20Thermal%20Sensor/MLX90614_Therm_Sensor.py>

### The Setup

Vin to 3.3V - 
GND to gnd
SCL to GPIO3 (SCL)
SDA to GPIO2 (SDA)




If connected properly, you should see something different than -- in at least one of the buckets when running:

```sh
i2cdetect -y 1
```


## The Base Code: Python


We will require these packages to read the MLX90614 sensor data with Python:

* Install Adafruit-blinka <https://pypi.org/project/Adafruit-Blinka/>
* and also: adafruit-circuitpython-mlx90614 <https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-mlx90614/>

The initial code of STJRush that we will tweak is this one below [it is a repo with very interesting projects worth to check](https://github.com/STJRush/handycode/tree/master)


```py

# This is the code to run the MLX90614 Infrared Thermal Sensor
# You'll need to import the package "Adafruit Blinka"
# You'll need to import the package "adafruit-circuitpython-mlx90614/"
# You'll need to enable i2c on the pi https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-i2c/
# Reboot after enabling i2C
# Sensor is connected to 3.3V, GND and the i2C pins 3(SDA) and 5(SCL)

import board
import busio as io
import adafruit_mlx90614

from time import sleep

i2c = io.I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA, frequency=100000)
mlx = adafruit_mlx90614.MLX90614(i2c)

ambientTemp = "{:.2f}".format(mlx.ambient_temperature)
targetTemp = "{:.2f}".format(mlx.object_temperature)

sleep(1)

print("Ambient Temperature:", ambientTemp, "°C")
print("Target Temperature:", targetTemp,"°C")
```


### Pushing MLX90614 Data to InfluxDB

We will be using 2 existing containers:
* <https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb/tags>
* <https://hub.docker.com/_/python>

We have 3 mandatory components for this to work, all of them [in this folder](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/RPi/Z_IoT/MLX90614-to-InfluxDB):

* The adjusted Python code that pushed data: <https://github.com/JAlcocerT/RPi/Z_IoT/MLX90614-to-InfluxDB/Python2InfluxDB.py>
* https://github.com/JAlcocerT/RPi/Z_IoT/MLX90614-to-InfluxDB/Python2InfluxDB-Stack.yml
* The docker image that isolates all of this and allow us to deploy easier: <https://hub.docker.com/r/fossengineer/iot/tags>
    * The tag is: dht11_sensor_to_influxdb

And another one if you want to replicate the docker build process:

* The https://github.com/JAlcocerT/RPi/Z_IoT/MLX90614-to-InfluxDB/Dockerfile>

#### Why InfluxDB
