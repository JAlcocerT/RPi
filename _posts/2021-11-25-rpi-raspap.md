Make your **RPi work as a router** that you can trust on your trips while connecting to unknown networks.

There are 2 modalities:

* RPi + RaspAP as Wifi Repeater
  + [x] A Raspberry Pi (Im using a Pi4 2gb, ARM32) with [Raspberry Pi OS installed](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/getting-started/#how-to-get-started-with-a-rpi)
  + [x] Ethernet Cable
  + [ ] We will use Ethernet to connect the RPi to Internet and then server an amplified WIfi signal with the built in Wifi  


* RPi + RaspAP as Wifi AP
  + [x] A Raspberry Pi, ofc
  + [ ] A Wifi dongle / usb stick compatible

> And there is also a containerized [(Docker) way to use RaspAP](#raspap-with-docker)

## RaspAP is All You Need

### RaspAP Quick Setup

* https://github.com/RaspAP/raspap-webgui?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-installer

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get full-upgrade
sudo reboot
 
sudo raspi-config
 
curl -sL https://install.raspap.com | bash
```


The built in wlan0, will be generating our hotspot (by default)

Following a reboot, the wireless AP network will be configured as follows:


```sh
IP address: 10.3.141.1
Username: admin 
Password: secret
DHCP range: 10.3.141.50 â€” 10.3.141.255
SSID: raspi-webgui
Password: ChangeMe
```

You can check the status of the services with:

```sh
sudo systemctl status hostapd #allows your Raspberry Pi to act as a wireless access point
sudo systemctl status dnsmasq #provides DNS and DHCP services, including handing out IP addresses to connected clients.

sudo systemctl status lighttpd #web interface running

```

The wireless interface should also be ready:

```sh
ip a
#iwconfig
```


> Remember, the default pass is `ChangeMe`, you can configure it by accessing the UI: `10.3.141.1`

## FAQ

* The Wifi adapter must be **OpenWRT compatible** (?)
