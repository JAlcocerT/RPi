## What it is MQTT?

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight **messaging protocol** designed for efficient communication between devices in constrained environments, commonly used in IoT (Internet of Things) applications.

* To get Startet with RPi and MQTT we will need:
  * An **[MQTT broker](#install-mqtt-broker) is a server** that acts as an intermediary for MQTT communication, facilitating message exchange between devices by receiving, routing, and delivering messages to subscribed clients.
  * Any device or software component that establishes a connection to an MQTT service using the TCP/IP protocol can be referred to as an **[MQTT client](#install-mqtt-client)**.

### Why MQTT for IoT?

MQTT is popular for IoT due to its lightweight nature, minimal bandwidth usage, and support for low-power devices, making it ideal for communication in resource-constrained environments.

## MQTT Setup with Raspberry Pi

- [ ] MQTT

  + [ ] Install a MQTT Broker
  + [ ] Testing the MQTT Broker
  + [ ] Test the Connection

### Install MQTT Client

There are many options - I like [MQTTX](https://mqttx.app/) which is free.

Which you can install in any platform (and even SelfHost MQTTX with Docker).

Here is how to install MQTTx with [Flatpak](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/debian/linux_installing_apps/#flatpak):

```sh
flatpak install flathub com.emqx.MQTTX
```

### Install MQTT Broker

For simplicity, we can install EMQx with [Docker using this Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/emqx) - Deploy with [Docker-compose](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/tree/main/IoT) or CLI:

```sh
docker pull emqx/emqx:5.5.0
docker run -d --name emqx -p 1883:1883 -p 8083:8083 -p 8084:8084 -p 8883:8883 -p 18083:18083 emqx/emqx:5.0.0 #5.5.0
```

You have other MQTT Broker options like [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto), [VerneMQ](https://github.com/vernemq/vernemq) or [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server)

[Mosquitto supports](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#architectures-other-than-amd64) many CPU architectures out of the box.

If you have a Raspberry 32bits like me, you can use [this Mosquitto Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mbixtech/arm32v7-mosquitto) instead, as the MQTT Broker

```sh
docker run -d -e TZ=Europe/Madrid -p 1883:1883 mbixtech/arm32v7-mosquitto --name mosquitto
#https://hub.docker.com/r/panuwitp/mosquitto-arm
#https://github.com/somsakc/docker-mosquitto

#docker ps --format '{{.Names}}'
  #docker logs mosquitto
  #docker exec -it mosquitto /bin/sh
```

### How to Test EMQx

We can now test that both MQTT Client and Server are ready for our projects.

* One way to do this is to build some sample script that pushes data:
  * MQTT Test With [Python](#sending-mqtt-message-with-python)
  * MQTT Test [With C](#sending-mqtt-message-with-c)
  * Some [other options](#how-to-push-data-to-mqtt) to push data to mqtt

#### Sending MQTT Message with Python

We just need Python and Paho installed:

```sh
pip install paho-mqtt
```

Create this [Python script](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/RPi/tree/main/Z_MQTT/Python):

```py
import paho.mqtt.publish as publish

# MQTT Broker (EMQX) details
broker_address = "broker.emqx.io" #change to any other adress, like 192.168.3.200 at Home
port = 1883
topic = "python/mqtt"

# Message to publish
message = "Hello from Python!"

# Publish the message
publish.single(topic, message, hostname=broker_address, port=port)
print(f"Message Published to {topic}")
```

Then just execute it:

```sh
python3 python-push.py
```

#### Sending MQTT Message with C

We will need C installed and the MQTTClient package - which we will build from source:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential git cmake

git clone https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c.git
cd paho.mqtt.c

cmake -Bbuild -H. -DPAHO_WITH_SSL=OFF
cd build
make
sudo make install

```

Create [this C script](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/RPi/blob/main/Z_MQTT/C/mqtt_publish_server.c):

```sh
nano mqtt_publish_server.c
```


Then we can compile our code
```sh
gcc -o mqtt_publish_server mqtt_publish_server.c -lpaho-mqtt3c #compile
./mqtt_publish_server #execute
```

## How to Visualize MQTT Data

### Node-Red

Install Node-Red with Docker - we will use [this image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nodered/node-red/):

```sh
docker run -it -p 1880:1880 -v myNodeREDdata:/data --name mynodered nodered/node-red
```

You can access it now at: `localhost:1880`

Then in the UI: go tu user settings -> Install and add both ([node-red-contrib-open](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-open) and [node-red-dashboard](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard))


> You can use [this docker-compose] to deploy Node-Red together with EMQx

### MQTT-Explorer

With [MQTT-Explorer](https://github.com/thomasnordquist/MQTT-Explorer) we can have a quick look on the trends of data we are receiving.

It is cross platform and you can install it with:

```sh
snap install mqtt-explorer #app-image also available
```

### PostMan

You can subscribe to [MQTT Topics with Postman](https://blog.postman.com/postman-supports-mqtt-apis/), plus you will have a nice real time visualization out of the box.

Install it with:

```sh
flatpak install flathub com.getpostman.Postman
```

## MQTT with Home Assistant

We can install [HA with Docker](#how-to-install-ha) to have it ready for our MQTT projects

---

## FAQ

### How to Install HA

You can install [Home Assistant with Docker](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/rpi-iot-dht11-influxdb/#how-can-i-install-home-assistant) following this steps - It is part of another [IoT Project with InfluxDB and DHT11](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/rpi-iot-dht11-influxdb/).

* Go to: `localhost:8123`

Then use the [MQTT Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt) (*we are lucky it is [not an add-on](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/rpi-iot-dht11-influxdb/#ha-add-ons)*)

* Settings - Devices and Services -> Add Integration -> MQTT
  * Then you will add the address and port of your MQTT Broker (and user/pass if needed)

To finish, configure MQTT integration listen to the topic that you are interested to get data.

#### What about CanBus?

CAN bus is like a private walkie-talkie system used by different parts of a car to talk to each other quickly and directly, helping them work together smoothly. 

But  MQTT is more like sending messages through a mail system, where you write a message, put it in an envelope with an address (called a topic), and send it to a central post office (called a broker), which then delivers the message to anyone who is interested in receiving it. 

While CAN bus is great for fast and direct communication within a single place, like a car, MQTT is better for sending messages between different places or devices, like smart home gadgets, over the internet.
