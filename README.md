Start your journey with a **Raspberry Pi and explore its role in IoT**, embedded computing, and data analytics, all on one compact board. 

[**See the Raspberry Pi Projects** â†’][demo]

You can also [get started with **Linux**](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/) with a RPi. Also with [Docker](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker).

The guides are available in Web version on: <https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/>

> The web generated with the files of this repository and GH Actions.

## Guides Structure

* RPi Setup: first steps for new users and self-hosting
* IoT & Data Analytics: using sensors, Python, Docker and more.
* Networking: improving your home internet

In the folders starting with `Z_` you have supporting materials for the projects.

For example `Z_IoT` contains Scripts used in IoT Projects with the RPi.
