Public repository for the github page: <https://JAlcocerT.github.io/RPi/>

Now the content of the associated GH page is created with Hugo - Cupper Theme.

The files that form the website were previously created with [**the knit package**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/knitr/) directly in R.
